# Course Scheduling Problem

Course timetabling problem is a well-researched NP-hard problemwhere the goal is to create a course timetable with a given number of professors, courses, and time slots. There are certain constraints that need to be followed to ensure that professors are not over booked and that courses, which may be scheduled by a student in the same semester, are not scheduled during overlapping time slots. The focus of this problem is, given sets of courses, professors and time slots, a schedule is generated where maximum objective function is satisfied which is having no conflicts over the set of constraints. To solve this problem, Genetic Algorithm is used.
